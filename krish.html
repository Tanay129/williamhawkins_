  <h1>INDIA: From The Eyes Of Marco Polo</h1>
  

  <h2 class="heading" id="intro">Captain William Hawkins</h2>
  <p class="t">On August 24, 1607, William Keeling and Sir William Hawkins, an ambassador for the English East India Company, set sail for Surat in the ship Hector. However, soon after the Hector landed in Surat in August 1608, Hawkins was taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Hawkins had been despatched to Surat by the English East India Company in order to secure official authorisation for the construction of an English factory. He was told that the Portuguese king controlled all of the ports and that no one could enter India without a permit from him. Hawkins was able to get a pass despite the difficult circumstances to travel to Agra.
    Subsequently, Hawkins continued his journey to the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir in Agra. It was a perilous and arduous journey, but on April 16, 1609, he finally reached Agra. During his time in the Mughal court, which lasted for two years, Hawkins served as an envoy. He presented a personal letter from the English East India Company to Emperor Jahangir, which was read aloud in the court.

  <h2 class="heading" id="ind">Marco Polo's Path to India</h2>
  <p class="t">Indeed, Marco Polo, his father Niccol√≤, and his uncle Maffeo embarked on a remarkable journey to India after spending several years in China. The exact route they took to reach India remains as a confusion among historians and researchers. However, it is believed that they likely followed the marine trade routes that connected China with the Indian subcontinent during that time.
    Upon reaching the southern edge of India, specifically the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Polo and his entourage would have encountered a vibrant and culturally diverse region. Tamil Nadu and Kerala, situated on the south-western coast of India, have a long history of maritime trade and cultural exchange with various civilizations.
    During Polo's time, these regions were known for their bustling trade ports, such as Calicut (now Kozhikode) and Quilon (now Kollam), which were frequented by merchants from across the world. The maritime trade routes brought spices, textiles, precious gems, and other valuable commodities from India to distant lands, making it a sought-after destination for traders like Polo.
    </p>
  
  <h2 class="heading" id="tn">Arrival in Tamil Nadu: A World of Wonders</h2>
  <p class="t">When Marco Polo's ship made landfall on the Coromandel Coast, the expedition ventured into the kingdom of the Tamil Pandyas, which encompassed significant portions of present-day Tamil Nadu. This region, with its magnificent historical and cultural heritage, became the backdrop for Polo's exploration. As he stepped onto the shores of Tanjore, he found himself immersed in a land brimming with vitality, where every corner breathed life into a tapestry of vibrant customs and architectural marvels. With his keen sense of observation, Polo meticulously documented the essence of the area, skilfully capturing the intricate social fabric and the mesmerizing beauty that enveloped the kingdom. Through his discerning eye for detail, Polo unveiled a world that transcended time, leaving an enduring impression of the splendour and richness of the Tamil Pandyas' culture and their remarkable contributions to the heritage of Tamil Nadu. </p>

  <h2 class="heading" id="heat">The Sights Of India In The Heat</h2>
  <p class="t">During Polo's travels across Tamil Nadu, he would have indeed experienced the region's tropical climate, characterized by high temperatures and humidity. The oppressive heat might have been quite different from what he was accustomed to in other parts of the world.
    In response to the climate, both the king and the common people would have adapted their clothing to protect themselves from the heat. Polo would have observed that many individuals, including the king, wore loincloths, which were simple garments wrapped around the waist and extending to cover the thighs. 
    These loincloths were likely made of a lightweight and breathable cloth which was a suitable option for the hot climate.
    </p>
  
  <h2 class="heading" id="cul">Cultural Customs and Religious Practices</h2>
  <p class="t">Marco Polo's keen curiosity extended to the social and religious practices of the people he encountered. He was intrigued by the Indian addiction to betel nut leaf, observing how people perpetually chewed it and spat out the saliva it produced. The act of spitting this juice in someone's face became a grave insult in their society. Additionally, Polo was captivated by the religious diversity in India, particularly the practices of Jainism.</p>
  
  <h2 class="heading" id="jai">Jainism: A Path of Non-Violence</h2>
  <p class="t">Polo's exploration of India exposed him to the country's religious diversity, which deeply fascinated him. One particular religious tradition that caught his attention was Jainism. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence, asceticism, and compassion towards all living beings. Jains follow a strict vegetarian diet and adhere to principles of non-harming.
    Polo likely encountered Jain temples and observed the practices of Jain ascetics, who led a life of renunciation and strict discipline. The Jain philosophy and way of life, which advocated non-violence even towards the smallest of creatures, would have struck Polo as a unique and distinct religious practice.

  <h2 class="heading" id="con">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="t">Absolutely, Marco Polo's journey to India undoubtedly enriched his understanding of the country's people, landscapes, and culture. His keen observations and vivid descriptions provided a remarkable account of India, allowing Europeans to glimpse the wonders of this ancient civilization.
    Polo's encounters with the diverse people of India would have exposed him to various ethnicities, religions, and social customs. Through interactions with the locals, he would have witnessed the vibrant tapestry of Indian society and gained insights into its complexities and nuances. His ability to document and share these experiences broadened the European understanding of the world beyond their own borders.
    The landscapes of India, ranging from majestic mountains to lush tropical forests, would have left a lasting impression on Polo. His descriptions of the natural beauty, breath-taking vistas, and unique ecosystems of the country would have ignited the imagination of European readers, fuelling their curiosity about distant lands and encouraging further exploration.
    Furthermore, Polo's documentation of the rich cultural tapestry of India expanded European knowledge of the arts, traditions, and philosophical beliefs of the Indian people. His observations of religious practices, architectural marvels, and intricate artistic creations served as an inspiration for future travellers and scholars.
    By sharing his experiences and insights in his famous travelogue, "The Travels of Marco Polo," Polo contributed to the development of travel literature. His writings sparked a fascination with the exploration of distant lands and encouraged European explorers and navigators to embark on their own journeys of discovery.
    Polo's accounts of India, along with his descriptions of other regions he visited, laid the foundation for the Age of Exploration and furthered the European quest for knowledge and trade in the wider world. His legacy as a travel writer and explorer continues to inspire generations, offering a valuable glimpse into the marvels of India and the diversity of our global civilization.
